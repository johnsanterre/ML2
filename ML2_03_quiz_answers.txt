# ML2 Week 3 Quiz: Answer Key

Data Understanding & Preprocessing:
1. b) To ensure all features are on similar scales for better network training
   - Different features have different scales which can affect model training

2. b) Population
   - Population values have the highest variance in the dataset

3. b) To find features most predictive of house prices
   - Helps identify which features have strongest relationships with target

4. c) To properly evaluate model performance without overfitting
   - Separate validation set provides unbiased performance estimation

Model Architecture:
5. b) They prevent vanishing gradients and add non-linearity
   - ReLU provides necessary non-linearity without gradient issues

6. c) To learn higher-dimensional representations
   - Wider layers help capture complex patterns in data

7. b) Because we're predicting a single value (house price)
   - Regression task requires single output value

8. b) The model becomes linear
   - Without activation functions, compositions of linear layers remain linear

Training Process:
9. b) To prevent gradient accumulation from previous batches
   - Gradients need to be reset for each new batch

10. b) To enable dropout and batch normalization training behavior
    - Different behavior needed during training vs evaluation

11. d) 0.001
    - Common starting point for neural networks

12. b) 32
    - Good balance between computation and gradient stability

13. b) It adapts learning rates and includes momentum
    - Adaptive optimization often works better than basic SGD

14. b) When gradients are exploding
    - Prevents unstable training from large gradients

15. b) To prevent overfitting
    - Stops training when validation performance starts degrading

16. b) After each epoch
    - Balances monitoring frequency with training efficiency

17. b) Better final convergence
    - Allows fine-tuning of optimization process

18. b) When validation loss improves
    - Saves best performing model states

19. b) To tune hyperparameters
    - Provides unbiased performance estimation for tuning

20. b) Mean Squared Error
    - Appropriate for continuous value prediction

Model Evaluation:
21. b) Average price prediction error in the same units as house prices
    - RMSE maintains original units

22. b) 80% of variance in prices is explained by the model
    - R-squared represents explained variance

23. b) It's less sensitive to outliers
    - MAE provides different perspective on errors

24. b) With small to medium-sized datasets
    - More important when data is limited

25. b) Validation loss higher than training loss
    - Classic sign of overfitting

26. c) Investigate and make informed decisions
    - Context matters for outlier handling

27. c) Validation metrics on same data split
    - Provides fair comparison between models

28. b) When outliers significantly affect results
    - Median less sensitive to extreme values

29. c) Using prediction intervals
    - Provides estimate of prediction uncertainty

30. b) To identify systematic prediction errors
    - Helps understand model weaknesses

Deployment:
31. c) Preprocessing parameters (like StandardScaler)
    - Required for consistent data processing

32. b) Use the same strategy as during training
    - Maintains consistency between training and inference

33. c) Monitoring prediction errors and distribution shifts
    - Catches performance degradation

34. c) Based on application requirements and latency needs
    - Depends on specific use case

35. c) Reproducibility and rollback capability
    - Essential for production systems

36. c) Use A/B testing and gradual rollout
    - Safer deployment strategy

37. c) Save weights, preprocessing parameters, and configuration
    - Everything needed for reproduction

38. c) Implement detection and handling strategy
    - Robust approach to unexpected inputs

39. c) Load balancing and resource management
    - Critical for production performance

40. c) Full specifications including training data, parameters, and limitations
    - Complete documentation essential for maintenance

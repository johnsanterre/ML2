WEEK 13: EVALUATING LLMS - METRICS AND METHODS

1. Traditional NLP Evaluation
   - Quantitative metrics
     * BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR
     * Perplexity
     * F1 scores
   - Task-specific metrics
     * Question answering accuracy
     * Translation quality
     * Summarization evaluation
   - Limitations of traditional metrics
     * Context sensitivity
     * Semantic understanding
     * Human-like evaluation

2. LLM-Specific Evaluation
   - Benchmark suites
     * GLUE and SuperGLUE
     * BIG-bench
     * HELM framework
   - Capability testing
     * Reasoning assessment
     * Knowledge probing
     * Task generalization
   - Behavioral evaluation
     * Instruction following
     * Output consistency
     * Chain-of-thought accuracy

3. Human Evaluation Protocols
   - Evaluation frameworks
     * Likert scales
     * A/B testing
     * Expert review protocols
   - Annotation guidelines
     * Quality criteria
     * Rubric development
     * Inter-rater reliability
   - Systematic assessment
     * Blind evaluation
     * Control questions
     * Statistical significance

# ML1 Week 14: Understanding Bias in Deep Learning Systems

## Overview
This week examines how bias can be introduced, detected, and mitigated in deep learning systems, from data collection through model deployment.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this session, students will:
- Identify sources of bias in deep learning

# From Basic Probability to High Dimensions: Understanding the Limits of Traditional Statistics

## 0. Statistical Significance in High Dimensions

### 0.1 The P-value Problem
Traditional statistical testing relies heavily on P-values:

```python
# Traditional hypothesis testing
from scipy import stats

def traditional_ttest(group1, group2, alpha=0.05):
    t_stat, p_value = stats.ttest_ind(group1, group2)
    return p_value < alpha  # Significant if True
```

### 0.2 Multiple Comparison Problem
When testing many hypotheses simultaneously:

```python
# Multiple testing example
import numpy as np

def multiple_tests_example(n_tests=1000):
    # Generate random data (null hypothesis is true)
    data = np.random.normal(0, 1, (n_tests, 100))
    control = np.random.normal(0, 1, 100)
    
    # Perform multiple t-tests
    p_values = [stats.ttest_ind(sample, control)[1] for sample in data]
    
    # Count "significant" results at Î±=0.05
    false_positives = sum(p < 0.05 for p in p_values)
    print(f"False positives: {false_positives} out of {n_tests}")
    # Typically around 50 false positives (5% of 1000)
```

### 0.3 Correction Methods and Their Limitations
```python
def bonferroni_correction(p_values, alpha=0.05):
    n_tests = len(p_values)
    # Corrected threshold
    threshold = alpha / n_tests
    return sum(p < threshold for p in p_values)
```

## 1. Foundations of Probability

### 1.1 Basic Probability Review
Let's start with a simple example. Imagine we're analyzing customer purchase patterns:

```python
# Simple probability example
total_customers = 1000
bought_product_a = 300
probability_a = bought_product_a / total_customers  # 0.3 or 30%
```

This works well for single events. The probability is clear, measurable, and computationally simple.

### 1.2 Conditional Probability
When we start looking at related events, we use conditional probability:

```python
# Conditional probability
bought_both_a_and_b = 150
bought_a = 300

probability_b_given_a = bought_both_a_and_b / bought_a  # 0.5 or 50%
```

### 1.3 Bayes' Theorem
Bayes' Theorem helps us update probabilities based on new evidence:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

```python
# Bayes' Theorem example
p_spam = 0.2  # Prior probability of spam
p_word_given_spam = 0.01  # Probability of word in spam
p_word = 0.001  # Overall probability of word

p_spam_given_word = (p_word_given_spam * p_spam) / p_word
```

## 2. The Multiplication Problem

### 2.1 Chain Rule of Probability
For independent events, we multiply probabilities:

```python
# Chain probability example
p_word1 = 0.1
p_word2 = 0.1
p_word3 = 0.1

p_sequence = p_word1 * p_word2 * p_word3  # 0.001
```

### 2.2 Computational Underflow
As sequences get longer, numbers become extremely small:

```python
# Underflow demonstration
def calculate_sequence_probability(p_individual, sequence_length):
    p_sequence = p_individual ** sequence_length
    print(f"Probability: {p_sequence}")
    return p_sequence

# Try with increasing lengths
p = 0.1
for length in [5, 10, 20, 50]:
    print(f"Length {length}:")
    calculate_sequence_probability(p, length)
```

Output shows numbers becoming vanishingly small:
- Length 5: 1e-5
- Length 10: 1e-10
- Length 20: 1e-20
- Length 50: 1e-50 (beyond typical floating-point precision)

## 3. The Data Sparsity Problem

### 3.1 Combinatorial Explosion
Consider a simple text analysis problem:

```python
# Vocabulary size calculation
vocabulary_size = 10000
sequence_length = 5
possible_combinations = vocabulary_size ** sequence_length

print(f"Possible combinations: {possible_combinations}")
# Output: 100,000,000,000,000,000,000 (10^20)
```

### 3.2 Real-World Data Limitations
Even with massive datasets, we can't observe all possibilities:

```python
# Dataset coverage example
dataset_size = 1_000_000  # 1 million documents
words_per_document = 1000
total_sequences = dataset_size * words_per_document

coverage_ratio = total_sequences / possible_combinations
print(f"Coverage ratio: {coverage_ratio}")
# Output: Effectively zero
```

## 4. The Curse of Dimensionality

### 4.1 Volume in High Dimensions
The volume of a high-dimensional space grows exponentially:

```python
import numpy as np

def hypersphere_volume(dimensions, radius=1):
    return (np.pi ** (dimensions/2) * radius**dimensions) / np.special.gamma(dimensions/2 + 1)

# Compare volumes
for dim in [2, 3, 5, 10, 20]:
    vol = hypersphere_volume(dim)
    print(f"Dimensions: {dim}, Volume: {vol:.2e}")
```

### 4.2 Data Sparsity in High Dimensions
Consider a simple clustering problem:

```python
# Data points needed for density
def points_needed_for_density(dimensions, divisions_per_axis=10):
    points = divisions_per_axis ** dimensions
    print(f"Dimensions: {dimensions}, Points needed: {points:e}")
    return points

# Show exponential growth
for dim in [2, 3, 5, 10]:
    points_needed_for_density(dim)
```

## 5. Why Traditional Methods Break Down

### 5.1 Probability Estimation Problems
In high dimensions, we can't reliably estimate probabilities:
- Most combinations never occur in training data
- Can't interpolate between sparse observations
- Probability estimates become unreliable
- P-values become meaningless due to multiple testing

### 5.2 The Multiple Testing Crisis
In high-dimensional data analysis:
- Each dimension potentially requires statistical testing
- Traditional corrections become too conservative
- False Discovery Rate control often fails
- Need for new approaches to significance

### 5.3 The Need for Different Approaches
This leads us to modern machine learning approaches:
1. Continuous representations (embeddings)
2. Dimensional reduction techniques
3. Neural network architectures
4. Learning manifolds in high-dimensional space
5. Alternative measures of significance

## 6. Modern Solutions

### 6.1 Embeddings
Instead of discrete probabilities, we use continuous representations:

```python
# Word embedding example (conceptual)
word_embedding = {
    "cat": [0.2, -0.5, 0.1],  # 3D instead of 10000D one-hot
    "dog": [0.3, -0.4, 0.2],
    "pet": [0.25, -0.45, 0.15]
}
```

### 6.2 Neural Networks
Neural networks learn to map high-dimensional data to useful representations:
- Automatic feature extraction
- Nonlinear transformations
- Dimensional reduction
- Manifold learning

### 6.3 Modern Statistical Approaches
Modern solutions to the multiple testing problem:
- False Discovery Rate (FDR) control
- Empirical Bayes methods
- Permutation testing
- Cross-validation for significance

```python
# Example: Permutation test for significance
def permutation_test(data1, data2, n_permutations=1000):
    observed_diff = np.mean(data1) - np.mean(data2)
    combined = np.concatenate([data1, data2])
    
    # Generate null distribution
    null_diffs = []
    for _ in range(n_permutations):
        np.random.shuffle(combined)
        perm1 = combined[:len(data1)]
        perm2 = combined[len(data1):]
        null_diffs.append(np.mean(perm1) - np.mean(perm2))
    
    # Calculate empirical p-value
    p_value = sum(abs(null_diff) >= abs(observed_diff) 
                 for null_diff in null_diffs) / n_permutations
    return p_value
```

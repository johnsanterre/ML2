# 0.01: Python Fundamentals - From Scripts to Classes

## Overview
This preliminary session helps students transition from basic scripting to object-oriented Python programming. We focus on practical examples that demonstrate why and how to use classes to better organize code.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this session, students will be able to:
- Understand when to use classes vs. simple scripts
- Convert basic scripts into class-based code
- Recognize the benefits of object-oriented organization
- Write basic Python classes with confidence

## Topics Covered

### 1. From Scripts to Functions
- Why functions help organize code
- Moving from global variables to parameters
- Basic function structure and naming

### 2. Why Classes?
- Real-world examples of when classes help
- The problem with too many functions
- Keeping related data and functions together

### 3. Basic Class Structure
- Class definition and initialization
- Instance variables vs. global variables
- Simple methods and self

### 4. Practical Example
- Starting with a basic script
- Converting to functions
- Final conversion to class structure

## Example Transformation
We'll work through converting this:
```python
# Basic script
name = "Alice"
items = ["book", "pen"]

print(f"Hello {name}")
for item in items:
    print(f"You have a {item}")
```

Into this:
```python
class Student:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.items = []
    
    def add_item(self, item):
        self.items.append(item)
    
    def show_inventory(self):
        print(f"Hello {self.name}")
        for item in self.items:
            print(f"You have a {item}")
```

## Key Concepts
- Organization of related code
- Data encapsulation
- Method structure
- Instance creation and usage

## Common Pitfalls
- Forgetting self
- Global variable confusion
- Over-complicating class structure
- When not to use classes

## Practice Exercise
Students will convert a simple calculator script into a Calculator class, learning the benefits of object-oriented organization along the way.

# WEEK 14: LLMs AS DECISION MAKERS AND AGENTS

## Overview
This week explores how to leverage LLMs for autonomous decision-making, routing, and agentic workflows. We focus on designing systems where LLMs make structured decisions and act as intelligent agents within larger systems.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this session, students will:
- Understand LLMs as decision-making components
- Design robust decision-routing systems
- Implement agentic workflows
- Evaluate decision quality and reliability
- Build safeguards for autonomous systems

## Topics Covered

### 1. LLMs as Decision Makers
- Decision Framework
  * Structured output formats
  * Decision criteria specification
  * Confidence scoring
  * Fallback mechanisms
- Use Cases
  * Content moderation
  * Request classification
  * Priority assignment
  * Action selection

### 2. Routing and Workflow Control
- Router Architecture
  * Input analysis
  * Decision points
  * Routing logic
  * Feedback loops
- System Integration
  * API endpoints
  * Queue management
  * State tracking
  * Error handling

### 3. Agentic Workflows
- Agent Design
  * Goal specification
  * Action space definition
  * State representation
  * Decision boundaries
- Control Flow
  * Sequential decisions
  * Parallel processing
  * Coordination mechanisms
  * Conflict resolution

### 4. Safety and Reliability
- Decision Validation
  * Confidence thresholds
  * Human oversight
  * Decision logging
  * Audit trails
- Error Handling
  * Edge cases
  * Fallback strategies
  * Recovery mechanisms
  * System boundaries
